In Fire Watch project I analysed data about fire department interventions in my region (Opole Voivodeship, Poland), gathered by Fire Watch algorithm (created for the purpose of this project).
Based on this data I was able to determine where are the highest risk areas and how do they correspond to the fire station locations.
I also managed to find the optimal locations for fire stations, considering distance to the analysed events.

Topics explored in this project:
- data scraping from html sites
- gathering geolocations through api tool
- converting response to json format and extracting data
- machine learning basics - exploring K-means algorithm possibilities
- geolocation data analysis and interpretation

Libraries and tools:
- sklearn
- BeautifulSoup
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- request
- time
- json
- statistics
- math
- AdjustText
